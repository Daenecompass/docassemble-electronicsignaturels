  About this web site
subquestion: |
  The federal government is the largest funder of Philadelphia Legal
  Assistance (PLA), and the government imposes a number of
  requirements on PLA.  One of these requirements is that PLA obtain
  documentation that all of its clients are either citizens, permanent
  residents, refugees, asylees, or persons in the process of becoming
  permanent residents.  Some exceptions apply.

  If you are a citizen, we need a signed document from you, called a
  "Citizenship Attestation," in which you say that you are a citizen.
  If you are an immigrant, we do not need your signature, but we need
  a copy of your immigration documentation.

  This web site allows you to sign a Citizenship Attestation or upload
  a copy (or a photograph) of your immigration documentation.  If you
  are not able to submit the documentation using this web site, you
  can submit it by mail, fax, or in person.  Please contact
  ${ ls.sidebar_advocate } at PLA to make arrangements to provide the
  documentation by one of these methods.
